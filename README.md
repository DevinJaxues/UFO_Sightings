## Overview ##
---
In this challenge our purpose was to create a HTML webpage and JavaScript file that would interact with said webpage. We were tasked to created multiple functions that could: build a data table from a JavaScript data file, react to user clicks on a button, and update said data table based of filter input.

## Results ##

Our final result was a clean and functionable webpage holding data of UFO sightings. Dana could use this webpage now for her presentation. With our set of filters this would allow users to visualize most common states, cities, countries, dates and shapes. Such as El Cajon, California having 4 reports of the same shape UFO on the same date.

## Summary ##
---
A drawback I found was just the clutter of information. At first glance you get a huge paragraph that just dumps random info on you. Then just data of UFO sightings with no context of where they came from and their validity. Two recommendations I'd make are 1. A comment filter, allowing users to find commonly spoke about UFO's that match description. 2. The overall aesthetics could use work, the grey isn't super exciting, the filters dont line up because of word length, and the header paragraph is just random with no context.
